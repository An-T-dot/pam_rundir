Build Instructions
------------------

* Requirements
  ------------

  - A POSIX-compliant C development environment
  - GNU make version 4.0 or later
  - Linux-PAM

 Note that pam_rundir is obviously meant for Linux systems, and relies on Linux
 behaviors; Specifically:

  - that mkdir() will use effective user/group ID to set ownership of newly
    created directory, a Linux-specific behavior.
  - that unlink() on a directory will return EISDIR, whereas POSIX would have it
    return EPERM instead.


* Standard usage
  --------------

  ./configure && make && sudo make install

 will work for most users.


* Customization
  -------------

 You can customize paths and options via flags given to configure.
 See ./configure --help for a list of all available configure options.
